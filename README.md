# waybind

I wrote this to fill my need of doing simple rebindings to match the behaviour of my 60% keyboard on my laptop's keyboard. I'm using sway and I couldn't find suitable software for my needs.

It simply creates a virtual keyboard and repeats keystrokes from your keyboard, except when it detects the configured rebindings, then it replaces those keystrokes.

If you want to do complex macros take a look at [Hawck](https://github.com/snyball/Hawck). Waybind will never support those use cases.

There's nothing wayland specific about this rebinder, there's just no shortage of keyboard rebinders for X11, hence the name.

## Config

```
device: /dev/input/event0
rebinds:
  # Binds KEY_GRAVE to KEY_ESC
  # If modifier KEY_CAPSLOCK is also pressed then it's still KEY_GRAVE but KEY_CAPSLOCK is removed
  # If modifier is KEY_SHIFTLEFT then it's KEY_SHIFLEFT + KEY_GRAVE
  - from: KEY_GRAVE
    to: KEY_ESC
    with_modifiers:
      - modifier: KEY_CAPSLOCK
        to: KEY_GRAVE
      - modifier: KEY_LEFTSHIFT
        to: SKIP

  # Binds KEY_CAPSLOCK + KEY_BACKSPACE to KEY_DELETE
  - from: KEY_BACKSPACE
    with_modifiers:
      - modifier: KEY_CAPSLOCK
        to: KEY_DELETE

  # KEY_CAPSLOCK + KEY_F12 will make waybind exit
  - from: KEY_F12
    with_modifiers:
      - modifier: KEY_CAPSLOCK
        to: EXIT

  # Completely unbind KEY_CAPSLOCK
  - from: KEY_CAPSLOCK
    unbind: true
```
